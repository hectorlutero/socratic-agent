   1.4 Allowed languages / preference for JS or TS?

2. Current baseline (rate 0–5)
   2.1 DSA fundamentals (arrays/strings, hashing, stacks/queues, recursion)
   2.2 Trees & graphs  
   2.3 Dynamic programming  
   2.4 Big‑O reasoning & tradeoffs  
   2.5 Debugging speed under pressure

3. JavaScript depth (rate 0–5)

4. TypeScript depth (rate 0–5)
   4.1 Generics  
   4.2 Narrowing / unions / intersections

   5.5 Architecture (component boundaries, data fetching patterns)

6. Node.js (rate 0–5)
   6.1 Event loop & async IO  
   6.2 API design & error handling  
   6.3 Streams / backpressure  
   6.4 Testing & observability

7. Learning preferences
   7.1 Style preference: more hints / more struggle / balanced  
   7.2 Session length (25 / 45 / 60+ minutes)  
   7.3 Strict “interview mode” sometimes? (yes / no)

   7.5 What does “success” look like in 30 days? (measurable)

8. Logistics
   8.1 How many days/week can you practice? How many problems/day?  
   8.2 Do you want a recurring curriculum (plan) or ad‑hoc coaching per problem?
